    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Our 'Viking Ale' has turned out to be 5.5% ABV, which is unexpectedly strongâ€¦ The recipe is based on one recounted to John Locke and published in the Ulster Journal of Archaeology in 1859.
    </p>
    <p>
      Locke said he was told the tale by a peasant living in Cork in 1847 who claimed to be nearly 100 years old, and who said he got the story from his grandfather, which would take us to at least the late 1600s.
